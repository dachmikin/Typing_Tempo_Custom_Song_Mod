While playing the game Typing Tempo, I attempted to create a custom song but found that the Typechart Studio provided with the game didn't seem to be working, forcing me to manually create the files myself.

I took the liberty to code out a simple python project to help me simplify the process of adding custom music to this game. This code basically creates a new folder and json file within it in the game's practice mode folder, populates the file with the keyed in details and opens the browser and file explorer to pages relevant to your chosen song.

*To run this code, you likely will need to change two of the filepaths in the code, which I've commented out.*
This code has also only been designed for Windows as of the time of writing.
You will also require python to be installed on your device.

In future iterations, I hope to be able to fully automate the process by having the script pull the cover photo and mp3 automatically.

If there's any feedback or questions, feel free to let me know! Thanks!
